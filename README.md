This project was created with Create-react-app with no extra libraries. All functions and utilities were written by me and represent my typical code style. If allowed additional time I would add some unit tests to ensure code acuracy.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
